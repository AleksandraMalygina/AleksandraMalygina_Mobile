The way to provide test application with personal identifier (API key) 
is to refer to this key as to a variable saved outside the project.

My solution is to save personal key as an environment variable named MOBILE_CLOUD_EPAM_API_KEY
on your computer and refer to this variable from project's POM file (${env.MOBILE_CLOUD_EPAM_API_KEY}) 

In this case the project won't have to be recompiled each time token is changed.
Plus no secrets won't be stored in public repos.
